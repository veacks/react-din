# 03 Playground Integration

## Feature

Exercise the visual playground as an integrated audio-graph editor instead of a collection of isolated controls.

### F03-S01 Voice synth graphs run across transport, sequencing, voice, envelope, and output

**Given** a contributor builds a synth graph in the playground
**When** they connect `Transport -> StepSequencer -> Voice -> Osc -> ADSR -> Gain -> Output`
**Then** the store, engine, UI, and generated code remain coherent

### F03-S02 Saved graphs reload safely

**Given** a contributor saves a graph that includes sampler or output state
**When** the playground reloads
**Then** the graph is restored and transient playback state is sanitized

### F03-S03 Generated React code matches mixed audio and data graphs

**Given** a contributor uses data nodes and audio nodes in the same graph
**When** they open the code generator
**Then** the generated React code represents both audio routing and control routing

### F03-S04 Browser audio smoke remains available

**Given** timing-sensitive or browser-only audio behavior changes
**When** automated mocks are not enough
**Then** manual smoke coverage remains documented for real browser verification
